later ruler. The passage in question occurs upon a boundary-stone
which took place in the fourth year of Enlil-nadin-apli.[59] In the
who is of course to be identified with Nebuchadnezzar I., the immediate
predecessor of Enlil-nadin-apli upon the throne of Babylon. Now we
know from the "Synchronistic History" that Nebuchadnezzar I. was the
contemporary of Ashur-rÃªsh-ishi, the father of Tiglath-pileser I., and
Gulkishar.
418 years elapsed between the defeat of Tiglath-pileser I. by
Marduk-nadin-akhÃª and his own conquest of Babylon in 689 B.C.[60]
Tiglath-pileser was therefore reigning in 1107 B.C., and we know from
assigned approximately to 1120 B.C. Nebuchadnezzar I., the contemporary
1140 B.C.; and, by adding the 696 years to this date, we obtain an
approximate date of 1836 B.C. as falling within the reign of Gulkishar
of the Second Dynasty. This date supports the figures of the Kings'
1876 to 1822 B.C. But it should be noted that the period of 696 years

for solving the problem. For, if the first dynasty be subtracted from
of the historical dynasties. Thus, if we take the length of the first

(331-323 B.C.). If therefore we add 1910 years to 322 B.C., we obtain
2232 B.C. as the beginning of the historical period with which the
second dynasty of Berossus opened. It may be added that the same result

enumerating the dynasties II.-VI., Eusebius goes on to say that after

preserved in the Babylonian List of Kings. Thus the seventh dynasty of
was also the contemporary of Tiglath-pileser.[72] On this supposition
for the number of years assigned by Berossus to his third dynasty.[74]
A further confirmation of the date 2232 B.C. for the beginning of the
of 1903 years down to the time of Alexander of Macedon.[75] Assuming
back to 2233 B.C., a date differing by only one year from that obtained
for the beginning of Berossus' historical dynasties.
Thus there are ample grounds for regarding the date 2232 B.C.
